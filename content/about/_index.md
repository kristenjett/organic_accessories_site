#### History
Organic Accessories was opened in 2008 by Kristen Jett. The store started as an outlet for her to create and share custom-made belt buckles, bracelets, and jewelry, but as women appreciated Kristen's style and taste, she broadened her approach to include the clothing, gifts, and accessories on sale today. 

#### Our Owner
Kristen Jett is a mother of 3 from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She's worked in the fashion industry as a sales rep for over a decade and has a passion and eye for style. She's naturally generous and thoughtful and loves to help women express strength and identity through their style. She also loves spending time with her family, walking her 2 retrievers, and visiting new places.
